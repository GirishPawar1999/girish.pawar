## 🚀 About the Project

This portfolio is more than a personal website — it's a reflection of my journey, passion, and evolving skills in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Engineering.

As an AI/ML student, my focus lies at the intersection of:  
- 🤖 Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- ⚙️ MLOps and Deployment  
- ☁️ Cloud Computing (Azure/GCP)  
- 📊 Intelligent Data Pipelines

## 🎨 Design Inspiration

The UI/UX of this website draws inspiration from **OpenAI’s ChatGPT interface**.  
I wanted the experience to feel minimal, responsive, and interactive — just like modern conversational AI tools.
